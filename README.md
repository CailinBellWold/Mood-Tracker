## About the Project

## User Story 

AS the responsible grown-up for a young person,
I WANT TO stay aware of my kiddoâ€™s emotional state and help them self-regulate,
SO THAT I CAN communicate empathically with my kiddo and they can develop self-awareness.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a welcome dashboard,
WHEN the user clicks on the icon that represents the current outside weather,
Then both the page background color and the main picture change to reflect the preceived weather effect. 
WHEN  the user clicks on their mood,
THEN they are presented with two content materials to support or alter their mood, creating a fun experience for the user. 

GIVEN a mood entered,
WHEN the user clicks on their mood,
THEN the mood is saved to local storage and rendered in an unobtrusive mood tracker (defaulted to hidden).
